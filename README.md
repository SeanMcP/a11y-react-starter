# A11y React Starter

ðŸ’« A lightly-configured [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with accessibility checking baked in.

[Click here for the creact-react-app README](./CRA-README.md).

## Accessibility checks

In the project directory, you have the following baked in:

### jsx-a11y

jsx-a11y is a static AST checker for accessibility rules on JSX elements. If you use a linting text editor like VS Code, it will show you potential accessibility errors even before you hit save.

[View more information on jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).

### react-axe

react-axe by Deque provides accessibility auditing during development. Any errors identified are displayed in the console with helpful resources to fix the issue. Due to zero-configuration, react-axe is enabled by default in this application.
